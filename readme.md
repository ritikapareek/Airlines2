Created ASP .net Core Web API in VS 2019 Premium. Core logic is migrated from https://github.com/ritikapareek/Airlines

*How to run:*
VS 2019 > Debug > Start Without Debugging
Hit https://localhost:5001/api/shortestroute/JFK/YYZ on browser


*Caveats:*
Currently, there is no case insensitive support. I have not done Authorize/Authenticate.


*Tests: *
I have included basis unit test for JFK, YYZ.
